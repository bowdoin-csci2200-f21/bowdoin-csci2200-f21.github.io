### Resources 

Textbook: The class is based on the following textbook: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York. The book is not required. It is available online, and there are copies in Searles 224. Please email me if you feel you would benefit from reading this textbook. 


If you want to dive deeper into proofs and the mathematics of computer science, here are two good (free) resources: 

- [Building blocks for theoretical computer science](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/) by Margaret Fleck

- [Mathematics for Computer science](http://opendatastructures.org/LLM.pdf)by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer

There are many resources available online, and you are encouraged to explore. Anything that helps you learn, is a good resource!  If you find a good resource, we'd appreciate sharing with the class so that everyone can use it.


### Other algorithms classes on the www

I spend a lot of time checking out algorithm classes at other institutions, and throughout the years I have learnt a great deal from  open resources. As instructors I have the freedom to choose how many topics to include in the syllabus, what type of practice problems, how many, etc. I use open resources to calibrate this class to what other institutions are doing.  Below is a lis of classes I use and which I highly recommend: 
  
  *  Most recently, [Stanford CS 161](http://www-leland.stanford.edu/class/cs161/index.html) 
  *  UIUC [Algorithms](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) by Jeff Erickson
