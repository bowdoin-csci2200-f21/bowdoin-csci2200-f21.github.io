### Resources 

Textbook: The class is based on the following textbook: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York. The book is not required. It is available online, and there are copies in Searles 224. Please email me if you feel you would benefit from reading this textbook. 


If you want to dive deeper into proofs and the mathematics of computer science, here are two good (free) resources: 

- [Building blocks for theoretical computer science](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/) by Margaret Fleck

- [Mathematics for Computer science](http://opendatastructures.org/LLM.pdf)by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer

There are many resources available online, and you are encouraged to explore. Anything that helps you learn, is a good resource!  If you find a good resource, we'd appreciate sharing with the class so that everyone can use it.
