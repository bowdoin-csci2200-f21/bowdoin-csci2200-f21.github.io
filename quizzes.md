### Prechecks and Quizzes

* There will be prechecks and quizzes every week; they  will be released on Blackboard/Gradescope. 

* Both the prechekcs and the quizzes are individual (no group work) and  at __collaboration-level 3__ (no collaboration allowed, professor clarifications only).  
    *  Make sure you read and understand the department's [collaboration policy](https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php). You may not talk to or consult with anyone about the prechecks and quizzes, and this includes former students who took this class before you. You may not post on any public forum any of the questions on the prechekcs/quizzes. You may not enter any quiz question into any websites.  

*  __Prechecks:__ The prechecks are __open__ book/notes, so you may consult your book/notes (but not www) 

* __Quizzes:__ The quizzes are __closed__ book and notes; you may __not__ consult any resource that may give you a hint on how to go about solving the problems.
