# Algorithms,  Fall'21, Bowdoin College 


**Instructor:** Laura Toma 

**Meeting times:** Mon, Wed & Fri 10:05-11:30am

**Where:** Searles 127




Algorithms are the backbone of computer science. Everywhere computer sciences reaches, there is an algorithm! This class is an introduction to critical thinking and problem solving through the design and analysis of algorithms.

Overall,  the class will show that the "...subject of algorithms represents a powerful lens through which to view the field of computer science in general" [Kleinberg & Tardos]

### Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

  1. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental computational problems and the algorithms that were proposed to solve them
      1. Illustrate how these algorithms work
      2. Analyze their theoretical complexity 
      3. Use them as building blocks to design solutions to new problems 
  2. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental algorithmic design techniques (recursion, divide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming)
  3. Understand and apply the process of designing efficient algorithms
    1. Come up with ideas
    2. Argue whether they are correct
    3. Analyze their theoretical complexity and compare them
    4. Ask: Can we do better?
  4. Demonstrate the ability to design and analyze algorithms for new problems 


### Getting Ready for the Course

We'll spend the first week reviewing problems and concepts from Data Structures, such as linear search and binary search; big-oh; best cases and worst cases. If you are not sure what these mean, you probably want to go back and review them in order to make the beginning of the class smoother.  
In the first 3 weeks we'll dive deeper into analysis, which means we'll encounter logarithms and exponents. If you have not seen logarithms and exponents in a long time, it's a good idea to review them. 
These are all fundamental concepts and there are plenty of resources on the Internet. 

Weekly Flow: How will this class work?
This is an online class, which means that  all  materials will be posted for you to engage with them at home, asynchronously, that is, at your  time and pace. The class will meet synchronously twice a week, and these synchronous meetings will be to answer your questions, solve problems working in groups with your peers,  and build a classroom community.

Here's the weekly timeline:
Read the lecture notes and watch the video recordings:  Each week, your first task is to read/watch the materials for that week (lectures notes and the videos) and make a list of specific questions which you'll bring to the meetings.  It is expected that you will understand the basic ideas and results, but perhaps need clarifications with some details. 
           Time to budget: approx. 3 hours. Note: In a regular semester, the lecture would total about 3 hours. 
Pre-meeting check: This will cover very basic questions from the lecture. You need to do this pre-check before attending the first weekly meeting (note: This semester, this would be Wednesdays at 3pm). 
           Time to budget: 15 minutes
Attend the synchronous meetings: These weekly (zoom) meetings will be dedicated to going over your questions, working in groups, engaging with practice problems and building a class community. Before coming to the zoom meetings you need to study the materials for that week and do the pre-check.
           Time to budget: 3 hour
Review and  practice: Review  the week practice problems and their solutions; review the lectutre notes and focus on the details; use the self-study quizzes and the study questions to help evaluate your understanding. Work on the problems in the current assignment.   Finding a partner (or a group) to work with is strongly encouraged. Drop in to  virtual office hours, help sessions/ study groups to get your questions answered and prepare for the weekly quiz.
            Time to budget: 3 hours
Take the weekly quiz.
           Time to budget: (up to) 1 hour
Reflection. Throughout the semester there'll be different reflection forms.
           Time to budget: 15 minutes 

Time Commitment
You probably heard this before, taking a 4-class load is like having a full-time job in which you are expected to work at least 40 hours a week. You should expect to commit 10 hours a week to meet the expectations of the course, and perhaps 12 to excel. A tentative breakdown of the weekly time is provided above---- please budget 10-12 hours a week for this class.
What you can expect from me
My goal is to maintain the class to the same standard  as if it were "in-person". That is, the class will cover the same topics, and will not drop any materials. To support the learning I have created detailed lecture notes and an ample set of supporting study questions, practice problems and quizzes. Stay assured that at the end of the semester you will have learnt precisely the same topics and worked through the same problems --- as if you took this class  in a regular semester on campus. 
At the same time, I am also committed to being flexible. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any circumstances that hinder your learning, and we will work together to make an alternate plan.
Assignments, Assessment and Grading 
Below is the list of assignments and assessments that you can expect during the semester, and how they are taken into account in the overall grade. 
Ungraded formative assessments: Each week, for each topic,  I will provide a combination of study questions, self-quizzes and practice quizzes. These are not graded. They are provided to support your learning. We'll spend the synchronous meetings working with these problems. 
Pre-meeting checks:  There will be 10-12 pre-meeting checks, which are meant to be taken after working with the asynchronous lecture materials, and before coming to the first weekly meeting. These checks will be very easy, and their goal is simply to help you stay on track every week.
Assignments: There will be 4-6 assignments throughout the semester. Each assignment will consist of O(1) new problems for which you will be asked to come up with efficient algorithms. Expect the problems in the assignments to be hard, but fun. 
Quizzes: There will be a total of 15 quizzes, one per week. The quizzes will  be administered via Blackboard, and will be a combination of multiple-choice and short answer. Expect them to be short (at most one hour, but often shorter)  and focused on the specific topic discussed that week. 
[Exams: There will be no exams.]
Assignments and  Partner  Policy
The assignments will be hard. They will consist of new problems, sometimes seemingly unrelated to the class topics, which you will have to solve. Remember, one of the goals of the class is to provide the conceptual tools so that you can come up with solutions to new problems, on your own --- and that's the role of  the assignments.  Do not expect to sit down for an hour and solve everything at once (if you do, please let us know!). Instead, expect a process: read the problems, understand what they are asking, come up with initial ideas, figure out why they work or not, try to formulate questions, come up with improvements. The whole process is supposed to be interactive between you and your homework partner, your TAs, and myself. The problems in the assignments have been carefully chosen in order to provide an opportunity to learn deeper.
You may work on the assignments in a team (of at most 3 people). You can have the same team for all assignments, or you can change partners. You and your partner(s) will work together on the assignment throughout the whole process, you will write it and review it together, and will submit one assignment. The assignment must be a true joint effort, equally owned, created and understood by both partners. Specifically splitting the assignmen and working on them separately is not allowed and violates the honor code for the class.
Grading policy
The final grade will be computed based on 10 pre-checks, 13 quizzes and 5 assignments: 
Pre-checks:     10 checks x 1 point = 10 points
Quizzes:          13 quizzes x 5 points = 65 points
Assignments:    5 assignments x 5 points = 25 points
Journal, discussions and class part: tie beraking 
The goal is to provide more than this number of assessments so that at the end everyone can drop their lowest (quiz, pre-quiz) score. For example, if we'll end up with 12 pre-checks and 14 quizzes , this means that you'll be able to drop your lowest 2 pre-checks, and drop your lowest  quiz. 

Group Work
Collaboration and discussion are crucial for this class in general, and especially this semester because it is online. You are encouraged to engage with the problems and discuss with peers as much as you can. You will most likely find that you will gain a better understanding of the material by discussing the problems with peers.
Our goal is to ensure that the collaboration is appropriate and effective, and that you become an independent problem solver capable to do work on your own. All students are expected to be familiar with and to comply with the department's collaboration policy  and the four levels of collaboration it outlines. Specifically for this class,
All work towards understanding the lectures, including study questions, practice problems and self-quizzes are  (unless otherwise specified)  at collaboration-level 0; that is, no restrictions.
The assignments, unless otherwise specified, will be at collaboration-level 1; that is, verbal collaboration without solution sharing. You are allowed and encouraged to discuss ideas with other class members, but the communication should be verbal. No one is allowed to take notes during the discussion (being able to recreate the solution later from memory is proof that you actually understood it). Communication cannot include sharing pseudo-code for the problem.
All pre-checks, quizzes and exams will be at collaboration-level 3 (no collaboration allowed, professor clarifications only).
While peer instruction can be immensely useful, it can also harm. Once you have an idea, or you found a solution, resist giving hints to your peers or leading them towards the answer. You are not helping them by doing so. Direct them towards the TAs who are trained to give help.
Remember that you are responsible for reading, understanding, and adhering to the department policy. If you have any questions about any aspects of the policy, please do not hesitate to ask for clarification.
Key Tips
You will probably find this class to be difficult. What makes it hard is that the material is theoretical and spans many levels of abstraction. Adding to that, coming up with algorithms is both an art and a science: there is no systematic way to have an idea, and problems that seem very similar, may have very different solutions. It is important that you know this ahead of time and you start preparing mentally for a challenging course.
Here are some suggestions for doing well in class:
Budget your time as suggested above and give yourself plenty of time to read the materials and work on the assignments each week. Plan on 10-12 hours a week, and make a schedule which you follow every week. 
Be pro-active about things that are not clear; search for resources on the Internet
Encourage self-reflection: Try to formulate questions, and try to answer them yourself.
Find a group of peers to work with. Explain your ideas, and listen to theirs. Try to argue why an idea is correct, or try to prove it wrong by finding an instance where it does not work.
Come to office hours, join the study groups and talk to the TAs; Listen to your peers' questions and get your questions answered.
Solve all problems that are assigned, even those that are optional.
Don't be harsh on yourself if you are not doing as well as you expected. Push yourself, don't focus on grades, enjoy the process!
