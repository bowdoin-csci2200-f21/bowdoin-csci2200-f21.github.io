# Algorithms,  Fall 2021, Bowdoin College 


**Instructor:** Laura Toma 

**Meeting time:** Mon, Wed & Fri 10:05-11:30am

**Where:** Searles 127


Algorithms are the backbone of computer science. Everywhere computer sciences reaches, there is an algorithm! This class is an introduction to critical thinking and problem solving through the design and analysis of algorithms.

Overall,  the class will show that the "...subject of algorithms represents a powerful lens through which to view the field of computer science in general" [Kleinberg & Tardos]

**Prerequisites:** csci 2101 (Data Structures)


### Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

  1. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental computational problems and the algorithms that were proposed to solve them
      1. Illustrate how these algorithms work
      2. Analyze their theoretical complexity 
      3. Use them as building blocks to design solutions to new problems 
  2. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental algorithmic design techniques (recursion, divide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming)
  3. Understand and apply the process of designing efficient algorithms
      1. Come up with ideas
      2. Argue whether they are correct
      3. Analyze their theoretical complexity and compare them
      4. Ask: Can we do better?
  4. Demonstrate the ability to design and analyze algorithms for new problems 


### Getting Ready for the Course
We'll spend the first week reviewing problems and concepts from Data Structures, such as linear search and binary search; big-oh; best cases and worst cases. If you are not sure what these mean, you probably want to go back and review them in order to make the beginning of the class smoother.  
In the first 3 weeks we'll dive deeper into analysis, which means we'll encounter logarithms and exponents. If you have not seen logarithms and exponents in a long time, it's a good idea to review them. 
These are all fundamental concepts and there are plenty of resources on the Internet. 


### Weekly flow: How will this class work?
The class meets (in-person) three times a week.    Each week we'll focus on certain topics and  work on a problem set.  Roughly speaking, the first two meetings of the week  are dedicated to going over the topics (the lecture).  The last meeting, designated as the _lab_, is  for you to work on the problem set. The lab problems are meant to be solved in class, during the lab. Myself and the TAs/LAs will be around to work with you, facilitate discussions and answer your questions. 

Here's the weekly timeline:

  1. **Read the lecture notes.**    Each week, before coming to class, your first task is to preview  the materials for that week (lecture notes). It is expected that you will understand the basic ideas and results, but need clarifications with some details. 
   
     * Time to budget:  2 hours.

  2. **Pre-meeting check.**  Each week, before coming to class, you need to take the pre-meeting check.  The pre-check is online and consists of a set of  easy multiple-choice questions; it covers very basic questions from the lecture. You need to take the pre-check before attending the first weekly meeting. The pre-checks are set so that you have 3 attempts and it will retain the highest score. It is open books and  no time limit.  
   
     * Time to budget: 15 minutes
           
  3. **Attend the weekly meetings.** Between listening to the lectures and working with your peers on problems, the goal is to  
   
     * Time to budget: 4.5 hours. 

  4. **Prepare and take the weekly quiz.** Review  the week practice problems and their solutions; review the lecture notes and focus on the details; use the self-study quizzes and the study questions to help evaluate your understanding. Drop in to  virtual office hours, help sessions/ study groups to get your questions answered and prepare for the weekly quiz.
    * Time to budget: 1-3 hours 
  
  5. Work on the current **assignment**.
  
   * Time to budget: 2 hours 


  
### Time Commitment
You probably heard this before, taking a 4-class load is like having a full-time job in which you are expected to work at least 40 hours a week. You should expect to commit 10 hours a week to meet the expectations of the course, and perhaps 12 to excel. A tentative breakdown of the weekly time is provided above---- please budget 10-12 hours a week for this class.

### What you can expect from me
My goal is to maintain the class to the same standard  as the peer institutions. I often choose problems from the top R1 universities such as Stanford, MIT, Berkeley. The class syllabus is packed, and you will find the pace and the problems challenging. To support everyone's learning at their own pace  I have created detailed lecture notes and an ample set of supporting study questions, practice problems and quizzes, with solutions.

At the same time, I am also committed to being flexible. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any significant circumstances that hinder your learning, and we will work together to make an alternate plan. 


### Find the level that's right for you
Based on your background, some of you will put in more or less time than what I suggested above. If you find that you struggle with discrete math (e.g. logarithms, exponents, etc) you'll need to alloate more time to grasp those concepts. If your logarithms are still fresh and you finish faster, take a look at the optional problems or just send me an email. 

 

### Assignments/Assessments and Grading 
Below is the list of assessments throughout the semester:  

- In-lecture ungraded exercises:  Lectures notes provide a combination of study questions and practice quizzes. These are not graded and are meant to support your learning. 

- Pre-meeting checks:  There are 12 pre-meeting checks. These checks are very easy, open books, unlimited time, and their goal is simply to help you stay on track every week.

-  Labs: There are 13 labs. The weekly labs consist of problem sets. The lab problems are meant to be finished in class, during the designated lab time,  working with a small group.  Labs are **not** graded.  
    -  Don't be surprised if you'll find that most of your learning occurs while you work on the lab with your peers!

- Quizzes: There are 14 quizzes,  one per week. The quizzes are administered via Blackboard/Gradescope, and are  a combination of multiple-choice and short answer questions. Expect them to be short (at most one hour, but often shorter)  and focused on the specific topic discussed that week. 

- Exams: There will be no exams.

- Assignments: There are 7 assignments throughout the semester (one every two weeks). Each assignment consists of O(1) new problems for which you will be asked to come up with efficient algorithms. Expect the problems in the assignments to be hard, but fun. 


### Grading policy

The final grade will be computed based on the pre-checks , 13 quizzes and 7 assignments: 

Pre-checks:     12 total,  drop two lowest: 10% 
Quizzes:        13 quizzes, drop 1 lowest: 60%
Assignments:    7 assignments: 30% 
Class participation: tie breaker 



### Key Tips
You will probably find this class to be difficult. What makes it hard is that the material is theoretical and spans many levels of abstraction. Adding to that, coming up with algorithms is both an art and a science: there is no systematic way to have an idea, and problems that seem very similar, may have very different solutions. It is important that you know this ahead of time and you start preparing mentally for a challenging course.
Here are some suggestions for doing well in class:
Budget your time as suggested above and give yourself plenty of time to read the materials and work on the assignments each week. Plan on 10-12 hours a week, and make a schedule which you follow every week. 
Be pro-active about things that are not clear; search for resources on the Internet
Encourage self-reflection: Try to formulate questions, and try to answer them yourself.
Find a group of peers to work with. Explain your ideas, and listen to theirs. Try to argue why an idea is correct, or try to prove it wrong by finding an instance where it does not work.
Come to office hours, join the study groups and talk to the TAs; Listen to your peers' questions and get your questions answered.
Solve all problems that are assigned, even those that are optional.
Don't be harsh on yourself if you are not doing as well as you expected. Push yourself, don't focus on grades, enjoy the process!
